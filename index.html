        <p>
           I am a MS Computer Science student at California State University, Fullerton, with a strong foundation in software development, algorithms, and web technologies. I hold a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science from Dr. Akhilesh Das Gupta Institute of Technology and Management, Delhi. My academic journey includes coursework in software design, databases, and artificial intelligence.

           I have experience working on web-based projects, including developing Fertizone, a fertilizer platform with features like order tracking and inventory management, using HTML, CSS, and Java. Additionally, I have worked with network load balancing techniques to optimize resource distribution. My technical skills include Python, C++, and web technologies.

           I am particularly interested in learning about modern web application frameworks, enhancing my full-stack development skills, and building scalable, high-performance applications. My background in Agile methodologies and CI/CD practices will support my learning in this course. I look forward to collaborating with students and deepening my understanding of web frameworks.
